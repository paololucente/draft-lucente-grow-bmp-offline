                          BMP State Summaries
                   draft-lucente-grow-bmp-offline-01

Abstract

   BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) [RFC7854] is perfectly suited for real-
   time consumption but less ideal in stream processing and off-wire
   historical scenarios.  The main issue is that the ability to
   correctly parse BGP Update PDUs, carried in BMP RouteMonitoring
   messages, depends on the BGP Capabilities exchanged during the
   establishment of the BGP session between the peers via BGP Open PDUs.
   The BGP Open PDUs, carried in BMP PeerUpNotification messages, are
   exported at the establishment of the BMP session.  Similar to BGP,
   BMP sessions are typically long-lived, so the crucial information to
   correctly parse subsequent messages of such sessions was possibly
   sent a relatively long time ago (days, weeks, months).

   This document introduces the concept of Summaries.  It defines a new
   optional BMP message type, called State Summary, and a new TLV,
   called Summary Id.  A Summary is similar to the initial
   synchronisation performed upon establishment of the BMP session: all
   BGP session information is exported in PeerUpNotification messages,
   and all RIB contents are exported in RouteMonitoring messages.  All
   the messages carry the new Summary Id TLV, containing an ID uniquely
   identifying the summary these messages belong to.  The messages are
   preceded by a State Summary message, carrying the same Summary Id
   TLV, as well as meta-data describing the Summary.

1.  Introduction

   Correctly parsing BGP Update PDUs included in BMP messages (ie.
   RouteMonitoring) does require a stateful approach by keeping track of
   capabilities exchanged in the BGP Open PDUs as reported by BMP
   PeerUpNotification messages.

Internet-Draft             BMP State Summaries             February 2025


   PeerUpNotification messages are sent only during the initial
   synchronisation at the start of the BMP session, or, whenever a BGP
   session is established on the monitored router.  The necessary
   information in the BGP Open (and PeerUpNotification) messages may
   thus have been received long before its needed to parse incoming BGP
   Updates in RouteMonitoring messages.  This inevitable stateful
   approach might be challenging in certain scenarios, such as consuming
   archived BMP messages or deployments where BMP Stations or processing
   nodes not necessarily see the (complete) start of every BMP stream.

   TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down Messages
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] defines a Stateless Parsing TLV aimed at
   including relevant capabilities that have an impact in BGP Update
   message parsing as part of optional informational TLV in Route
   Monitoring messages.  While the method is valid, in fact it does
   allow with minor effort to encapsulate BMP in MRT format for offline
   consumption as documented by Storing BMP messages in MRT Format
   [I-D.petrie-grow-mrt-bmp], it comes with some drawbacks like extra
   verbosity and increased correlation effort at a BMP exporter, where
   resources may be limited.

   Similar to how the necessary information carried in the BGP Open
   messages is sent from the exporter to the station only in the
   beginning of a BMP session (in forms of PeerUpNotifications), the
   contents of the RIBs is also only sent at the beginning (in forms of
   RouteMonitoring messages).  In other words, to make correct and
   complete sense of offline BMP data, both current state (RIB contents)
   and session details (BGP Open Capabilities) to parse future state
   changes are required.

   This document introduces Summaries, enabling synchronisation of both
   BGP session information and RIB contents anywhere in a BMP session.
   Summaries are enabled by the new optional State Summary message type
   and the new Summary Id TLV, both introduced in this document.  A
   Summary is a collection of PeerUpNotification messages,
   RouteMonitoring messages and a single State Summary message, all
   carrying the newly introduced Summary Id TLV containing the unique
   identifier for that Summary.  The State Summary message further
   contains TLVs with meta-data describing when the Summary was created,
   information on the exporting side such as sysName and IP address,
   and/or information on the collecting side such as BMP station
   software name and version, etc.

   The new concepts described in this document are not restricted to
   either the BMP exporter or the BMP station.  By building upon TLVs,
   supported in all BMP message types from BMPv4, the Summary approach
   imposes minimal requirements over the initial synchronisation in BMP
   today.  Furthermore, if at any point in the future another message

   type needs to be incorporated in a Summary, it will be a simple
   matter of attaching the Summary Id TLV to those messages.  No
   existing message types have to be adapted to support Summaries.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  State Summary message format

   The State Summary message starts with a BMP Common Header as defined
   in Section 4.1 of [RFC7854].  The Common Header is directly followed
   by non-indexed TLVs.  The Summary Id TLV defined in Section 3.1.1
   MUST be present and SHOULD be the first of the TLVs.  All additional
   TLVs listed in Section 3.1.2 are optional.

   The State Summary message can be generated by a BMP exporter or by a
   BMP station, as long as all required data for the PeerUpNotification
   and RouteMonitoring messages pertaining to the Summary are available.
   The State Summary message MUST be followed by those messages, with
   the Summary Id TLV attached.

3.1.  Summary Information TLVs

3.1.1.  Summary Id TLV

   The Summary Id TLV is the only mandatory TLV of a State Summary
   message as defined in Section 3.  It is a non-indexed TLV, structured
   as defined in Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv], with a fixed
   value length of 16 bytes.  This allows the use of UUID identifiers,
   or provides sufficient space for alternative schemes.  Different
   approaches for schemes are discussed in Section 4.

3.1.2.  Optional meta-data TLVs

   The Peer Summary message SHOULD carry TLVs providing additional
   information on the BMP session being summarized.  These Summary
   Information TLVs describe the BMP exporter and station involved, and
   the date and time the summary was generated.  By embedding these TLVs
   in the offline file, a consumer of the file does not have to rely on
   the filename or other external data to get these types of
   information.  All TLVs are non-indexed.

   *  Type = TBD3: Datetime of summary

         Length: 8 bytes

         Value: 64bit UNIX epoch, in seconds

   *  Type = TBD4: Exporter IP address

         Length: 16 bytes

         Value: IPv6 or IPv4-mapped IPv6 address

   *  Type = TBD5: Exporter sysName

         Length: variable, non-zero, describing the number of bytes

         Value: UTF-8 string

   *  Type = TBD6: Exporter sysDesc

         Length: variable, non-zero, describing the number of bytes

         Value: UTF-8 string

   *  Type = TBD7: Station IP address

         Length: variable, non-zero, describing the number of bytes

         Value: IPv6 or IPv4-mapped IPv6 address

   *  Type = TBD8: Station sysName

         Length: variable, non-zero, describing the number of bytes

         Value: UTF-8 string

   *  Type = TBD9: Station sysDesc

         Length: variable, non-zero, describing the number of bytes

         Value: UTF-8 string

3.2.  Third party off-wire encoding formats

   While this document does define a way to facilitate stream
   processing, replay and, more in general, consumption of raw BMP data
   offline, similar benefits may be harnessed by third party off-wire
   formats in replay and, more in general, consumption of raw BMP data
   offline, similar benefits may be harnessed by third party off-wire
   formats in which BMP can be encapsulated into, for example MRT

   (Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit) as defined by RFC 6396 [RFC6396].
   As a result of that, this document does not recommend a preferred way
   to stream process or store BMP data offline.

4.  Operational Considerations

4.1.  Summary Id scheme

   The generation and form of the Summary Ids introduced in this
   document is left to implementations.  This document does not enforce
   any specific approach, though at least the following points should be
   considered.  Note that implementations are not limited to supporting
   only one Id scheme, but ideally support multiple schemes via local
   configuration.

4.1.1.  Global uniqueness

   In deployments where information is received from multiple BMP
   vantage points, unique Summary Ids might prove handy or even crucial
   in order to distinguish Summary A originally sent by BMP exporter X,
   from Summary B sent by exporter Y.  If all exporting processes rely
   on an algorithm producing globally unique identifiers, e.g.  UUID
   version 4, they all can send out Summaries without possibly using an
   identical Summary Id generated by another exporter.

4.1.2.  Increasing identifiers

   Generating (linearly) increasing identifiers enable the BMP station
   to order Summaries, and, to spot any missing Summaries.  Furthermore,
   in a (long running) BMP session where the exporter generates
   Summaries, the Summary Id doubles as a counter signalling how many
   Summaries have been sent so far.  Note that some of these can be
   deduced via other means: ordering of Summaries can be done based on
   the Timestamp TLV (TBD3), and the number of sent Summaries could be
   included in the StatsReport message (Section 4.8 of [RFC7854]).

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to allocate a new Peer Summary message type in the BMP
   Message Types registry with value TBD1.  IANA is also asked to to
   create a registry within the BMP group, named "BMP Peer Summary
   Message TLVs".
