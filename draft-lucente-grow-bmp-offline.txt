Abstract

   BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) is perfectly suited for real-time
   consumption but less ideal in stream processing and off-wire
   historical scenarios.  The main issue is that the ability to
   correctly parse BGP Update PDUs, carried in BMP Route Monitoring
   messages, depends on the BGP Capabilities exchanged during the
   establishment of the BGP session between the peers via BGP Open PDUs.
   The BGP Open PDUs, carried in BMP Peer Up Notification messages, are
   exported at the establishment of the BMP session.  Similar to BGP,
   BMP sessions are typically long-lived, so the crucial information to
   correctly parse subsequent messages of such sessions was possibly
   sent a relatively long time ago (days, weeks, months).

   In addition to that required session state, the state of monitored
   RIBs is also only exported at the start of the BMP session.
   Afterwards, only deltas to that state are emitted, in forms of BMP
   Route Monitoring messages.  In order to construct a complete and
   correct view of the network, one can not rely on those deltas alone.
   While constructing the state purely on deltas might, eventually, get
   close to the 'actual' state of the network, there is no control over
   how long one is working with an incorrect state, nor is there any
   guaruantee that it ever will be correct.

   This document introduces the concept of Snapshots.  It defines a new
   optional BMP message type, called State Snapshot, and a new TLV,
   called Snapshot Id.  A Snapshot is similar to the initial
   synchronisation performed upon establishment of the BMP session: all
   BGP session information is exported in Peer Up Notification messages,
   and all RIB contents are exported in Route Monitoring messages.  All
   the messages carry the new Snapshot Id TLV, containing an ID uniquely
   identifying the snapshot these messages belong to.  The messages are
   preceded by a State Snapshot message carrying the same Snapshot Id
   TLV, as well as meta-data describing the Snapshot.

1.  Introduction

   Correctly parsing BGP Update PDUs included in BMP messages (ie.
   Route Monitoring) does require a stateful approach by keeping track
   of capabilities exchanged in the BGP Open PDUs as reported by BMP
   Peer Up Notification messages.

   Peer Up Notification messages are sent only during the initial
   synchronisation at the start of the BMP session, or, whenever a BGP
   session is established on the monitored router.  The necessary
   information in the BGP Open (and Peer Up Notification) messages may
   thus have been received long before its needed to parse incoming BGP
   Updates in Route Monitoring messages.  This inevitable stateful
   approach might be challenging in certain scenarios, such as consuming
   archived BMP messages or deployments where BMP Stations or processing
   nodes not necessarily see the (complete) start of every BMP stream.

   TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down Messages
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] defines a Stateless Parsing TLV aimed at
   including relevant capabilities that have an impact in BGP Update
   message parsing as part of optional informational TLV in Route
   Monitoring messages.  While the method is valid, in fact it does
   allow with minor effort to encapsulate BMP in MRT format for offline
   consumption as documented by Storing BMP messages in MRT Format
   [I-D.petrie-grow-mrt-bmp], it comes with some drawbacks like extra
   verbosity and increased correlation effort at a BMP exporter, where
   resources may be limited.

Internet-Draft             BMP State Snapshots              October 2025


   Similar to how the necessary information carried in the BGP Open
   messages is sent from the exporter to the station only in the
   beginning of a BMP session (in forms of Peer Up Notifications), the
   contents of the RIBs is also only sent at the beginning (in forms of
   Route Monitoring messages).  In other words, to make correct and
   complete sense of offline BMP data, both current state (RIB contents)
   and session details (BGP Open Capabilities) to parse future state
   changes are required.

   This document introduces Snapshots, enabling synchronisation of both
   BGP session information and RIB contents anywhere in a BMP session.
   A Snapshot is not one single message, but a collection of messages,
   all containing a Snapshot Id TLV (introduced in this document)
   carrying the same Snapshot Id.  The session state and RIB contents
   are carried in Peer Up Notification messages and Route Monitoring
   messages, respectively, exactly like the initial synchronisation upon
   establishment of a new BMP session.  In addition to the Peer Up
   Notification and Route Monitoring messages, two State Snapshot
   messages (introduced in this document) are also included in a
   Snapshot: one preceded all the other messages, signalling the start
   of the Snapshot and optionally containing TLVs carrying metadata
   about the Snapshot.  And one State Snapshot messages at the very end,
   signalling the end of the Snapshot, again optionally containing TLVs
   carrying metadata.  These TLVs are described in Section 4.3.

1.1.  Exporter vs Station

   The new concepts described in this document are not restricted to
   either the BMP exporter or the BMP station, as all newly introduced
   pieces are in-protocol and do not rely on any specific characteristic
   of either exporter or station.  However, as the process of emitting a
   Snapshot can presumably be expensive, it is not to be expected that
   BMP export implementations on routers will support the concepts
   introduced in this document.  A BMP station on the other hand likely
   has more resources available, and will have received all the
   necessary information (in terms of session state and RIB contents)
   from the router already.  To not burden limited routers more than
   necessary, the authors assume the 'first' BMP station implements the
   concepts described so any stations 'downstream' can leverage the
   Snapshot functionality, while not imposing any additional load on the
   router originally emitting the BMP stream.

1.1.1.  Considerations regarding alternative approaches


   // This section is included as a record of discussion, and is to be
   // removed/reduced at a later stage.

   Emitting all contents of a RIB is very similar, if not identical, to
   the process of a Route Refresh [RFC2918].  For routers exporting BMP
   streams, the assumption is that they support Route Refresh.  The
   authors evaluated if mimicking a Route Refresh could provide
   functionality similar to State Snapshots, but at lower
   (computational) cost.  While a full overview of key features/
   requirements is listed in Table 1, it was concluded that a Route
   Refresh lacks (too) many of the features of a Snapshot.  Moreover, it
   would still be considered too expensive to perform on any regular
   basis on routers.

1.2.  Flexibility and extensibility

   By building upon TLVs, supported in all BMP message types from BMPv4,
   the Snapshot approach imposes minimal requirements over the initial
   synchronisation in BMP today.  Furthermore, if at any point in the
   future another message type needs to be incorporated in a Snapshot,
   it will be a simple matter of attaching the Snapshot Id TLV to those
   messages.  No existing message types have to be adapted to support
   Snapshots.

1.3.  Backwards (in)compatibility

   If an implementation lacking support for Snapshots receives a
   Snapshot, it should ignore the State Snapshot messages and the
   Snapshot Id TLVs, as these are all optional.  However, this reduces a
   Snapshot to a bunch of Peer Up Notification and Route Monitoring
   messages indistinguishable from 'normal' Peer Up Notification and
   Route Monitoring messages.  This introduces the following problems:

   *  Peer Up Notifications from a Snapshot will be interpreted as
      normal Peer Up Notifications, though for a peer that was already
      considered 'up'.  This situation is not explicitly described in
      Section 3.3 of [RFC7854], and can be considered unexpected.  Even
      though application of Peer Up Notifications could be considered
      idempotent (the state after processing the message is 'this peer
      is up' regardless of how often that message is received and
      processed), receiving the message implicitly signals the peer was
      down before, which is incorrect, and is possibly a source of
      confusion.

   *  Route Monitoring messages from a Snapshot interpreted as normal
      Route Monitoring messages would not come as unexpected in the life
      cycle of a BMP session.  Similarly to Peer Up Notification
      messages, their application is idempotent in nature as the result
      of processing the message is 'this route is reachable'.  Note that
      Route Monitoring messages from a Snapshot will always be
      announcements, not withdrawals.  However, as with Peer Up
      Notification messages, a normal Route Monitoring message
      implicitly signals 'this route was not reachable before', which is
      incorrect in the case of Route Monitoring messages that were
      actually part of a Snapshot.

1.3.1.  Possible workaround

   *  Partial support: dropping messages based on Snapshot Id TLV
      presence

Internet-Draft             BMP State Snapshots              October 2025


      If a station implementation does not support State Snapshots, it
      should be able to recognize Snapshot Id TLVs relatively easily.
      With BMPv4, the BGP Update is carried in a TLV in the Route
      Monitoring message, so any implementation will be able to process
      TLVs to a certain extent.  It then only needs to be aware of the
      type code of the Snapshot Id TLV type: as all messages in a
      Snapshot will carry a TLV of this type, the implementation can
      simply skip/drop those messages, and preclude any of the problems
      described above.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  State Snapshot message

   Every Snapshot contains exactly two messages of the Snapshot type:
   one preceding all the Peer Up Notifications and Route Monitoring
   messages containing the actual data, and one Snapshot message to
   signal the end.  Both follow the same wireformat.

3.1.  Wireformat

   The State Snapshot message starts with a BMP Common Header as defined
   in Section 4.1 of [RFC7854].  The Common Header is directly followed
   by TLVs.  The Snapshot Id TLV defined in Section 4.1 MUST be present
   and SHOULD be the first of the TLVs.  All additional TLVs listed in
   Section 4.3 are optional.

      Figure 1: The State Snapshot message wireformat, including the
                BMP Common Header and the Snapshot Id TLV.

   The State Snapshot message can be generated by a BMP exporter or by a
   BMP station, as long as all required data for the Peer Up
   Notification and Route Monitoring messages pertaining to the Snapshot
   are available.  The State Snapshot message MUST be followed by those
   messages, with the Snapshot Id TLV attached to every message.

3.2.  Start-of-snapshot

   The Snapshot message preceding all other messages in the Snapshot
   should contain TLVs providing useful metadata for the consumer of the
   Snapshot.  For example, the timestamp of snapshot generation, and
   information about the exporter (IP address, software version).
   Furthermore, they can describe which address families are included in
   the snapshot, and for which RIB views (e.g. Adj-RIB-In Pre-policy).
   Note that, as all meta-data TLVs are optional, a consumer of
   Snapshots should never rely on presence of any of these TLVs.

3.3.  End-of-snapshot

   After all Peer Up Notification and Route Monitoring messages of the
   Snapshot, the end of the Snapshot is signalled by means of another
   Snapshot message.  This Snapshot message contains the Snapshot Id TLV
   like all other messages comprising the Snapshot.  This Snapshot
   message can also contain meta-data TLVs, most notably the Snapshot
   Error TLV.  If, for whatever reason, the sending side can not

   complete the Snapshot, it MUST send a Snapshot message containing a
   Snapshot Error TLVs to signal the Snapshot is incomplete and/or
   incorrect.  For discussion on operational consequences, see
   Section 6.1.

4.  Snapshot Information TLVs

4.1.  Snapshot Id TLV

   The Snapshot Id TLV is the only mandatory TLV of a State Snapshot
   message as defined in Section 3.  It is an indexed TLV (as it will be
   included in Route Monitoring messages, with index zero), structured
   as defined in Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv], with a fixed
   value length of 16 bytes.  This allows the use of UUID identifiers,
   or provides sufficient space for alternative schemes.  Different
   approaches for schemes are discussed in Section 6.

4.2.  Snapshot Error TLV

   The Snapshot Error TLV is used to signal that a sender can not
   complete a currently in-flight Snapshot, and MUST be included in the
   End-of-snapshot Snapshot message the sender sends to signal the end
   of the (in this case incorrect/incomplete) Snapshot.  Sending out the
   End-of-snapshot Snapshot message is crucial, as failing to do so
   leaves the consuming end in a state where it expects more messages
   pertaining to the Snapshot.  The value in a Snapshot Error TLV is a
   UTF-8 string of arbitrary length, describing the failure reason.
   Note that the Snapshot Error TLV is useful for live connections, but
   less so for offline data on persistent storage: as it's clear the
   Snapshot is incorrect or incomplete, one would likely want to replace
   it with a valid Snapshot instead of archiving the incorrect one.

4.3.  Optional meta-data TLVs

   The Peer Snapshot message SHOULD carry TLVs providing additional
   information on the BMP session being summarized.  These Snapshot
   Information TLVs describe the BMP exporter and station involved, and
   the date and time the snapshot was generated.  By embedding these
   TLVs in the offline file, a consumer of the file does not have to
   rely on the filename or other external data to get these types of
   information.  All TLVs are non-indexed.

5.  Third party off-wire encoding formats

   While this document does define a way to facilitate stream
   processing, replay and, more in general, consumption of raw BMP data
   offline, similar benefits may be harnessed by third party off-wire
   formats in replay and, more in general, consumption of raw BMP data
   offline, similar benefits may be harnessed by third party off-wire
   formats in which BMP can be encapsulated into, for example MRT
   (Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit) as defined by RFC 6396 [RFC6396].
   As a result of that, this document does not recommend a preferred way
   to stream process or store BMP data offline.

6.  Operational Considerations

6.1.  End-of-snapshot with an Error TLV


6.2.  Snapshot Id scheme

   The generation and form of the Snapshot Ids introduced in this
   document is left to implementations.  This document does not enforce
   any specific approach, though at least the following points should be
   considered.  Note that implementations are not limited to supporting
   only one Id scheme, but ideally support multiple schemes via local
   configuration.

6.2.1.  Global uniqueness

   In deployments where information is received from multiple BMP
   vantage points, unique Snapshot Ids might prove handy or even crucial
   in order to distinguish Snapshot A originally sent by BMP exporter X,
   from Snapshot B sent by exporter Y.  If all exporting processes rely
   on an algorithm producing globally unique identifiers, e.g. UUID
   version 4, they all can send out Snapshots without possibly using an
   identical Snapshot Id generated by another exporter.

6.2.2.  Increasing identifiers

   Generating (linearly) increasing identifiers enable the BMP station
   to order Snapshots, and, to spot any missing Snapshots.  Furthermore,
   in a (long running) BMP session where the exporter generates
   Snapshots, the Snapshot Id doubles as a counter signalling how many
   Snapshots have been sent so far.  Note that some of these can be
   deduced via other means: ordering of Snapshots can be done based on
   the Timestamp TLV (TBD3), and the number of sent Snapshots could be
   included in the Stats Report message (Section 4.8 of [RFC7854]).

7.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to allocate a new Peer Snapshot message type in the BMP
   Message Types registry with value TBD1.  IANA is also asked to to
   create a registry within the BMP group, named "BMP Peer Snapshot
   Message TLVs".

   Registration procedures for this registry are:
