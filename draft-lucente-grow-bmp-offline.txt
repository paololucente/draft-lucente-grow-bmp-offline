                       Making BMP usable offline
                   draft-lucente-grow-bmp-offline-01

Abstract

   BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) [RFC7854] is perfectly suited for real-
   time consumption but less ideal in stream processing and off-wire
   historical scenario.  The main issue is the dependence that parsing
   BGP Update PDUs has on knowing which capabilities have been agreed
   when establishing the BGP session with the peers, which could have
   happened long time ago (days, weeks, months).

   This document defines a new optional BMP message type, called Peer
   Summary, that carries a summary of the established BGP sessions along
   with their capabilities and that is intended to be injected in the
   BMP feed at configurable time intervals and/or ad-hoc whenever it is
   felt necessary to improve fruition of BMP data after it has been
   collected.

1.  Introduction

   Correctly parsing BGP Update PDUs included in BMP messages (ie.
   Route Monitoring) does require a stateful approach by keeping track
   of capabilities exchanged at BGP Open time as reported by BMP Peer Up
   messages.

   The role of Peer Up messages is solely BGP session event logging and
   the long-lived nature of sessions does pose the problem that a BGP
   Open message may have been received long time before parsing a BGP
   Update making challenging a stateful approach based on receipt of
   Peer Up.

   TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down Messages
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] defines a Stateless Parsing TLV aimed at
   including relevant capabilities that have an impact in BGP Update
   message parsing as part of optional informational TLV in Route
   Monitoring messages.  While the method is valid, in fact it does
   allow with minor effort to encapsulate BMP in MRT format for offline
   consumption as documented by Storing BMP messages in MRT Format
   [I-D.petrie-grow-mrt-bmp], it comes with some drawbacks like extra
   verbosity and increased correlation effort at a BMP exporter, where
   resources may be limited.

   This document defines a new optional BMP message type named Peer
   Summary that carries a list of the established BGP sessions, along
   with their capabilities.  The general idea is that a Peer Summary
   message is composed by a sequence of one or multiple Peer TLVs with
   the goal of allowing a consumer of BMP data to build the list of
   established BGP sessions like if the sequence of Peer Up messages was
   just being received live by a BMP exporter.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Peer Summary message format

   The Peer Summary message starts with a BMP Common Header as defined
   in Section 4.1 of [RFC7854].  It is followed by a Peers Count which,
   similarly to how defined for Stats Reports message in Section 4.8 of
   [RFC7854], tells how many TLVs will follow in the message.  The count
   is then followed by one or multiple Peer TLVs with code-point TBD2.

   Each Peer TLV is structured as a non-indexed TLV as defined in
   Section 3 of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].  The value part contains the
   BMP Common Header and Peer Up Notification body as defined in
   Section 4.10 of [RFC7854].

   The Peer Summary message is generated at a BMP station, it MUST
   encapsulate only actually received Peer Up data from BMP exporters.

3.1.  Third party off-wire encoding formats

   While this document does define a way to facilitate stream
   processing, replay and, more in general, consumption of raw BMP data
   offline, similar benefits may be harnessed by third party off-wire
   formats in which BMP can be encapsulated into, for example MRT
   (Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit) as defined by RFC 6396 [RFC6396].
   As a result of that, this document does not recommend a preferred way
   to stream process or store BMP data offline.

4.  Operational Considerations

   The Peer Summary message injection in a BMP feed is done by an online
   BMP station for consumption by an offline consumer.  The advantage of
   creating summaries at the online BMP station (for example, as opposed
   to creating them at a BMP exporter) is that it has awareness of how
   offline data is being organized, for example:

   *  If BMP data is saved in files and a new file is created every five
      minutes, it may make sense to include the summary at the beginning
      of each file; or

Internet-Draft          Making BMP usable offline           January 2025


   *  If BMP data is streamed onto a message bus like Kafka that
      supports partitioning, it may be needed to broadcast summaries
      over each of the partitions as they may be attended by different
      consumers.

   A BMP station receiving multiple Peer Up for the same peer should
   perform state compression and include in the Peer Summary the last
   one received, based on timestamp, at the time the summary is being
   generated.  In other words, the summary is not meant, for example if
   a BGP session is flapping, as event reporting and this is left to BMP
   Route Event Logging [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-rel].

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to allocate a new Peer Summary message type in the BMP
   Message Types registry with value TBD1.  IANA is also asked to to
   create a registry within the BMP group, named "BMP Peer Summary
   Message TLVs".

   Registration procedures for this registry are:
