      <t>
        BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) is perfectly suited for real-time
        consumption but less ideal in stream processing and off-wire
        historical scenarios. The main issue is that the ability to
        correctly parse BGP Update PDUs, carried in BMP Route Monitoring
        messages, depends on the BGP Capabilities exchanged during the
        establishment of the BGP session between the peers via BGP Open
        PDUs. The BGP Open PDUs, carried in BMP Peer Up Notification
        messages, are exported at the establishment of the BMP session.
        Similar to BGP, BMP sessions are typically long-lived, so the
        crucial information to correctly parse subsequent messages of
        such sessions was possibly sent a relatively long time ago
        (days, weeks, months).
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition to that required session state, the state of monitored RIBs
        is also only exported at the start of the BMP session. Afterwards, only
        deltas to that state are emitted, in forms of BMP Route Monitoring
        messages. In order to construct a complete and correct view of the
        network, one can not rely on those deltas alone. While constructing the
        state purely on deltas might, eventually, get close to the 'actual'
        state of the network, there is no control over how long one is working
        with an incorrect state, nor is there any guaruantee that it ever will
        be correct.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document introduces the concept of Snapshots. It defines a new
        optional BMP message type, called State Snapshot, and a new TLV,
        called Snapshot Id. A Snapshot is similar to the initial
        synchronisation performed upon establishment of the BMP
        session: all BGP session information is exported in
        Peer Up Notification messages, and all RIB contents are
        exported in Route Monitoring messages. All the messages carry the new
        Snapshot Id TLV, containing an ID uniquely identifying the snapshot
        these messages belong to. The messages are preceded by a State
        Snapshot message carrying the same Snapshot Id TLV, as well as
        meta-data describing the Snapshot.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="Introduction">
      <t>
        Correctly parsing BGP Update PDUs included in BMP messages (ie.
        Route Monitoring) does require a stateful approach by keeping
        track of capabilities exchanged in the BGP Open PDUs as reported
        by BMP Peer Up Notification messages.
      </t>
      <t>
        Peer Up Notification messages are sent only during the initial
        synchronisation at the start of the BMP session, or, whenever a BGP
        session is established on the monitored router. The
        necessary information in the BGP Open (and Peer Up Notification)
        messages may thus have been received long before its needed to parse
        incoming BGP Updates in Route Monitoring messages. This inevitable
        stateful approach might be challenging in certain scenarios, such as
        consuming archived BMP messages or deployments where BMP Stations or
        processing nodes not necessarily see the (complete) start of every
        BMP stream.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv">TLV support for BMP Route
        Monitoring and Peer Down Messages</xref> defines a Stateless Parsing
        TLV aimed at including relevant capabilities that have an impact in
        BGP Update message parsing as part of optional informational TLV in
        Route Monitoring messages. While the method is valid, in fact it does
        allow with minor effort to encapsulate BMP in MRT format for offline
        consumption as documented by
        <xref target="I-D.petrie-grow-mrt-bmp">
          Storing BMP messages in MRT Format
        </xref>, it comes with some drawbacks like extra verbosity and increased
        correlation effort at a BMP exporter,
        where resources may be limited.
      </t>
      <t>
      Similar to how the necessary information carried in the BGP Open
      messages is sent from the exporter to the station only in the
      beginning of a BMP session (in forms of Peer Up Notifications), the
      contents of the RIBs is also only sent at the beginning (in forms of
      Route Monitoring messages). In other words, to make correct and complete
      sense of offline BMP data, both current state (RIB contents) and session
      details (BGP Open Capabilities) to parse future state changes are
      required.
    </t>
      <t>
      This document introduces Snapshots, enabling synchronisation of both
      BGP session information and RIB contents anywhere in a BMP session.
      A Snapshot is not one single message, but a collection of messages, all
      containing a Snapshot Id TLV (introduced in this document) carrying the
      same Snapshot Id. The session state and RIB contents are carried in Peer
      Up Notification messages and Route Monitoring messages, respectively,
      exactly like the initial synchronisation upon establishment of a new BMP
      session.
      In addition to the Peer Up Notification and Route Monitoring messages, two
      State Snapshot messages (introduced in this document) are also included in
      a Snapshot: one preceded all the other messages, signalling the start of
      the Snapshot and optionally containing TLVs carrying metadata about the
      Snapshot. And one State Snapshot messages at the very end, signalling the
      end of the Snapshot, again optionally containing TLVs carrying metadata.
      These TLVs are described in <xref target="meta-data-tlvs"/>.
    </t>
    <section title="Exporter vs Station">
    <t>
      The new concepts described in this document are not restricted to
      either the BMP exporter or the BMP station, as all newly introduced pieces
      are in-protocol and do not rely on any specific characteristic of either
      exporter or station.
      However, as the process of emitting a Snapshot can presumably be
      expensive, it is not to be expected that BMP export implementations on
      routers will support the concepts introduced in this document. A BMP
      station on the other hand likely has more resources available, and will
      have received all the necessary information (in terms of session state and
      RIB contents) from the router already. To not burden limited routers
      more than necessary, the authors assume the 'first' BMP station implements
      the concepts described so any stations 'downstream' can leverage the
      Snapshot functionality, while not imposing any additional load on the
      router originally emitting the BMP stream.
    </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Flexibility and extensibility">
    <t>
      By building upon TLVs,
      supported in all BMP message types from BMPv4, the Snapshot approach
      imposes minimal requirements over the initial synchronisation in BMP
      today. Furthermore, if at any point in the future another message
      type needs to be incorporated in a Snapshot, it will be a simple
      matter of attaching the Snapshot Id TLV to those messages. No
      existing message types have to be adapted to support Snapshots.

          The generation and form of the Snapshot Ids introduced in this

          enforce any specific approach, though at least the following
          points should be considered. Note that implementations are not

          <t>
            In deployments where information is received from multiple
            BMP vantage points, unique Snapshot Ids might prove handy or
            even crucial in order to distinguish Snapshot A originally
            sent by BMP exporter X, from Snapshot B sent by exporter Y.
            If all exporting processes rely on an algorithm producing
            globally unique identifiers, e.g. UUID version 4, they all
            can send out Snapshots without possibly using an identical
            Snapshot Id generated by another exporter.

            the exporter generates Snapshots, the Snapshot Id doubles as
            a counter signalling how many Snapshots have been sent so
            far. Note that some of these can be deduced via
            other means: ordering of Snapshots can be done based
            on the Timestamp TLV (TBD3), and the number of sent
